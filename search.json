You are able to translate text, speech, images, and websites from one language to another.\nFunctions include: Text, Speech, Image, and Website translation.\n\niii.The Interface design of Google Translate has input/output fields where you can text/speak into the original language then translate it to the preferred language. It contains different translation methods, such as text, voice, image, and even a handwriting option. It has a simple interface, I imagine because when in a situation to use the app in real life where there are language barriers, it is important to keep it simple and in a way where anyone can understand how to use it regardless of the language you speak.\nDoorDash - E-commerce and Food Delivery -\n\nPurpose is to provide consumers food, grocery, convenience store, and additional deliveries such as pet supplies and flower delivery. There are 3 parties involved, the consumer, merchant (restaurant/store), and delivery driver.\nFunctions of DoorDash for each party involved are as follows. Consumer Functions include the easy to use browsing for food/products, ordering/customizing your order, payment processing, tracking your order, and leaving a review. Functions of the merchant include order management, being able to update menus/prices, promotions, and sales information. Functions of the delivery driver include the ability to accept deliveries, navigating to the location, tracking earnings and tips, and showing delivery hotspots.\nThe interface design of Door Dash is user friendly, yet attention grabbing. There are many tabs showing what is popular, as well as any promotions or deals happening, including different categories of food or restaurants. It should be easy to use and navigate, as being hungry and confused is not a good combination. It is organized and attention grabbing, as well as displaying a simple check out screen.\n\nYelp - E-commerce and Digital Marketing -\n\nPurpose is to help businesses and professionals to expand their clientele and gain visibility, and help consumers search and discover businesses depending on their need and wants.

Functions of Yelp for businesses include having the ability to advertise and promote their business, respond to reviews, and create their own business profile.\n\niii.The simple interface design of Yelp includes being able to easily search different businesses by category and name.

Even though the data is being retrieved in an accurate way, we still need to analyze the data to uncover different trends, patterns, and allow for accurate decision making. Data mining can help predict trends, help decision making, and detect any issues.
