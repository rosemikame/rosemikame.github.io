Functions of the merchant include order management, being able to update menus/prices, promotions, and sales information. Functions of the delivery driver include the ability to accept deliveries, navigating to the location, tracking earnings and tips, and showing delivery hotspots.\nThe interface design of Door Dash is user friendly, yet attention grabbing. There are many tabs showing what is popular, as well as any promotions or deals happening, including different categories of food or restaurants.

Find the ID and name of each employee who lives in the same city as the location of the company for which the employee works:\nSELECT e.ID, e.person_name FROM employee AS e JOIN works AS w ON e.ID = w.ID JOIN company AS c ON w.company_name = c.company_name WHERE e.city = c.city;\n\nJoin employee with works using ID to get the company they work for\nJoin works with company using company name to get the companies city\nFilter employees whos city matches the companies city\n\n\nii. Find ID and name of each employee who lives in the same city and on the same street as does her or his manager.\nSELECT e.ID, e.person_nam FROM employee AS e JOIN manages AS m ON e.ID = m.ID JOIN employee AS mgr ON m.manager_id = mgr.ID WHERE e.city = mgr.city AND e.street = mgr.street;\n\nSelf join employee to compare an employee (e) with manager\nUse manages to get the manager id for each employee\nFilter employees who share the same city and street as their manager\n\n\niii. Find ID and name of each employee who earns more than the average salary of all employees of her or his company.\nSELECT e.ID, e.person_name FROM employee AS e JOIN works AS w ON e.ID = w.ID WHERE w.salary &gt; ( SELECT AVG(w2.salary) FROM works AS w2 WHERE w.company_name = w2.company_name)\n\nJoin employee with works to get salary information\nCompare each employees salary to the average salary of all employees working in the same company\n\n\nb) Consider the query… what is wrong with it?:\nUsing natural join can cause incorrect joins. Natural join joines tables based on common column names automatically If tables share multiple common columns, the database might join them incorrectly Could lead to wrong or missing results\n\nAmbiguous Column Names Semester and year columns are likely in the section table, but the query does not specify The database might get confused if other tables also have the columns\nMissing Explicit Conditions Instructor table has an ID column, but teaches also has ID Need to explicitly specify how tables are related using ON conditions\n\nIn short, the issue was due to the natural join making unintended matches, and the fixed query uses join… on to explicitly define relationships, preventing errors."

    "text": "This podcast was presented by Dr. Aldo Faisal and discussed the role of AI in healthcare. Key takeaways from this podcast were:\n\nUtilize federated machine learning to train AI models on sensitive healthcare data while preserving patient privacy, enabling the development of robust AI systems without compromising data security.\nInvestigate the potential of ambient intelligence in healthcare, which automates operational tasks like transcribing doctor-patient conversations and updating patient records, to reduce administrative burdens and enhance clinical decision-making.\nConsider the development of large health models, akin to large language models, that can process multimodal data from electronic health records, medical literature, and research data to provide comprehensive insights into patient care and treatment outcomes.\n\nReading the title of the podcast, what immediately came to mind was an AI robot doctor that you would see on TV. This is what Dr. Faisal mentioned in the beginning of the podcast, that this is not to be mistaken with just that. Using AI in the medical field can help doctors and nurses treat patients faster and more accurately. An example of how AI has helped within the medical space has been regarding diagnostics. According to Dr. Faisal, licenses for these are already in the process of being licensed and used in the workspace. AI can be used to help tumor/shadow detection on scans, transcribe a conversation between a doctor and patient, identify symptoms, make suggestions on medication, and prefill information to make the doctor’s clerical load lighter. \nNightingale AI is the name of Dr. Faisal’s project. Based in the UK, this is a large health model trained in electronic health records, imaging, labs, genetics, pathology, telemetry, and literature. The purpose is to have support provided for healthcare providers. Their main concern was how to obtain large amounts of medical data, which includes cooperating with healthcare providers and patients, and what to do with the data. It was mentioned that patients were concerned regarding their privacy and for their data to not be abused. However, Dr. Faisal stated that the main idea is to create an AI that learns about medicine in a different way that other large language models are applied to. They want to build models that are trained on multimodal data, so that the model is able to ingest, understand, and reason information the same way a medical doctor would reason science. \nExample given of how Nightingale AI will help doctors in the future: \n\nEx. The patient has a chest infection and the doctor will prescribe a certain type of penicillin. The system then can predict how the patient’s xray will look depending on what type of medicine that is prescribed to the patient. \nEx. The patient has liver issues and the doctor prescribes a drug to cure another issue in the kidney. How will this medication affect your liver and what are all of the possible side effects and how do all of these drugs interact with each other? What are all the positive and negative side effects? \nPolypharmacy problem - this is what pharma researchers want to know when testing a medicine and which populations they can test on without issues. \nEx. Can be used to understand how a patient evolves - the system has a “digital twin” which includes a description of your body’s physiology. This would be useful to see how an asthmatic patient would do in an environment that is hot, polluted, and can potentially save many lives\n\n\nNightingale AI is intended for use by AI, digital health, and clinical researchers so it can be focused on user experience and interface. Once the system evolves with a proper chat conversation prompt, it can be expanded for use within the general population. Dr Faisal mentioned something that stuck with me. Concerning patients and their data privacy, he mentioned that sick patients almost always give their data away. They want to give their data to get better and to help others who are sick as well. The aim of the healthy is to not give their data away. There are different laws that protect people and their data, as well as how it can be used by insurers or employers. Data leakage is a possible risk however they are considering that as well. \nOverall, this particular podcast gave some amazing insights into the use of AI within the healthcare sector. I am not familiar with the healthcare world, so this was very insightful and allowed me to understand more of how AI can be used around the world."
